    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 pinch sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>5 1/4 cups all purpose flour or bread flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place in a lightly oiled bowl, roll the dough to cover lightly with the oil, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a large clean kitchen towel, leave in a warm draft free area until doubled in bulk, approximately 2 hours.**</li>
        <li>Pre heat oven to 450° (250° celsius). Punch dough down a few times and divide into 1-3 balls, let dough rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in the desired pizza or cookie sheets (lightly oiled) and shape the dough into the desired shapes (using your clean hands). </li>
        <li>Top with your favourite toppings (without the cheese), bake for approximately 15-20 minutes (until crust is golden) and then top with grated mozzarella cheese and bake for three more minutes or until cheese is melted. Enjoy!</li>
        <li>**At this point, dough can also be refrigerated, place in plastic bag, remove air and tie securely up to 24 hours.</li>
    </ol>
