    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="recipe">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup any flavour yogurt** (I find flavoured regular natural yogurt to be the best / room temperature ) (250 grams)</li>
        <li>3 large eggs (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil (112 grams)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar (154.50 grams)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour or cake flour (225 grams)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven to 350F degrees (180 cm). Grease an 8 inch (20cm) cake pan or a 9Â½-10 inch (24 cm) bundt pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, using a hand mixer on medium speed, lightly beat the eggs approximately 30 seconds, add oil, sugar and yogurt, beat for 1 minute until smooth, add flour and baking powder and beat until well combined approximately another minute.</li>
        <li>Pour into the prepared cake pan and bake for approximately 35-40 minutes or until tested done (when a toothpick inserted in the centre of the cake comes out dry or with a few crumbs attached). Let cool 15-20 in the pan then move to a wire rack to cool completely. When cool, sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>
